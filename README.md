**Project:** How To Fail Your Research Degree - Digitized

**Platform:** Web App with PhaserJS

[*How To Fail Your Research Degree*](http://howtofailyourresearchdegree.com/) is an educational tabletop game by Daisy Abbott which aims to make students aware of the many pitfalls and difficulties that come with working on a research project and prepare them for their own project in a lighthearted and fun context.

With many interactions still taking place online, students find themselves isolated without many opportunities to interact with their peers. The aim of this project is to develop a digital version of *How To Fail Your Research Degree* which allows students to play the game remotely with their peers with the goal of keeping as many positive aspects of the tabletop version while also adding the advantages that come with online games.
